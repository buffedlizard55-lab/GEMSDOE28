# Three review passes (27GEMSDOE — Sessions 1 & 2)

## Pass 1 - implement and verify
* **Session 1:**
  * Inputs restored by hash (`scripts/restore_data.py`): labels, template, H19-5, the 0.2477 file, d2.8 file, lidar/radiometric rasters, training raster (`4371c82e...`).
  * Re-implemented the official DTI; tested against a literal brute-force transcription of the definition (random grids, soft predictions, masks) and, on a real cell, against the sibling's independent implementation (difference `0.00e+00`).
  * Regenerated the 0.2477 emission (60,069 px) and the sibling d2.8 emission (44,090 px) bit-for-bit.
  * Built the fault graph, links, evidence score, candidate set; pre-registered and ran the gates (seeds 100-109, then 110-119); built submissions.
* **Session 2 (executing previous session's next steps first):**
  * Restored `qfaults_v2_in_footprint.json` (`1,179` NBMG INGENIOUS Quaternary fault polylines, SHA-256 `4d6efc7bb3659ea2545353fcec574ef085b0acdb189c7590e4420a7c6c57b41c`), `gdr_volcanic_vents_in_footprint.csv` (`340` vents), `gdr_wellspring_in_footprint.csv` (`4,897` wells/springs), and `dem_links.json` (716 USGS 1 m DEM links; 706 successful derivatives, 10 failures; the prior 1,701 claim was corrected in the H28 continuation) via `data/manifest.json` and `scripts/restore_data.py`.
  * Created `scripts/download_competition_data.sh` (mirroring the official Dropbox competition data links) and `scripts/prepare_data.py` (building the 32-band label-free feature matrix `data_cache/prepared/features.npy`, `[5167373, 32]`, SHA-256 `83ed2704...`, excluding the mislabelled `tc` band and asserting all 18 remaining band descriptions).
  * Pre-registered and committed (`1487895`) **Addendum B** (seeds 120-129, 3-tier vector holdout + H27-5 kinematic typing) and **Addendum C** (seeds 130-139, honest 4-fold spatial-CV out-of-fold detector $B_{\text{oof}}$ gating H27-1, H27-4, and H27-3) in `knowledge/03_preregistration_topology_gate.md` *before* running the confirmatory scripts.
  * Implemented `src/gems27/vector_graph.py`, `scripts/fetch_vector_faults.py`, `.github/workflows/fetch-vector-faults.yml`, and `scripts/run_vector_topology_validation.py`; confirmed Addendum B gates (`component` `0.2926`, `FID_trace` `0.1003` vs `0.0204` ctrl, `H27-5a` `0.1374`, `H27-5b` `0.1783`, `NAME_zone` `0.0014`).
  * Implemented `src/gems27/oof_detector.py` and `scripts/run_oof_hypothesis_gates.py`; confirmed Addendum C gates on $B_{\text{oof}}$ (`plus_T_v2` `+0.0115` in 4/4 folds; `prune_r1_100m` `+0.0022` solo and `+0.0141` stacked with T-v2 in 4/4 folds; `coherence_h27_3` refuted `-0.0010` in 0/4 folds).
  * Annotated all 345 T-v2 dossiers with official NBMG/USGS fault attributes (`FID`, `NAME`, `NUM`, `FTYPE_`, `SLIPSENSE`, `DIPDIRECT`, `MAPSCALE`, `kinematic_compat`) and built the **Tertiary Slot 3 candidate (`d466b251f309`, 55,992 px = 0.2477 minus 5,355 100 m flank-shadow dots + 1,278 T-v2 dots)** alongside the unchanged Primary (`5512495c6bd1`) and Secondary (`3ebd51534bb1`) candidates.

## Pass 2 - bugs, assumptions, edge cases
| # | finding | action |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Implementation bug (Session 1):** the first confirmatory launch applied the minimum gap before choosing the nearest target, deviating from the registered rule (caught by a unit test) | fixed; run stopped, disclosed (`topology_validation_runA_partial_log.txt`), rerun as registered |
| 2 | **Defect in the graph edge builder (Session 1):** 1-px stubs recorded as self-loops inflated the cyclomatic number (504) | fixed; reported figures replaced (250 raw / 110 / 6 enclosed >= 20 px); no effect on links, validation or files |
| 3 | Mutual links appear twice (A->B, B->A): duplicate dot trains | de-duplicated variant added to the confirmatory run (efficiency 0.280 vs 0.226) and shipped |
| 4 | 8 of 345 links pass within ~100 m of a third system | kept (validated rule), flagged per link |
| 5 | Efficiency of "all links" (0.121) is below random same-size subsets (0.149): overlap saturates credit | null for z>=3 is the same-size random subset (p95 0.156), not the full set |
| 6 | **Band-order assumption in `prepare_data.py` (Session 2):** `det_elev` in `training_features.tif` is at band 12 (not band 8), while `dem_slope` is at band 8 | added explicit `EXPECTED_DESCRIPTIONS` assertion for all 19 bands in `scripts/prepare_data.py` before writing `features.npy` |
| 7 | **Vector attribution performance bottleneck (Session 2):** looping `pix_fid == i` over 1,179 full `(3730, 3292)` grids took >22s per call | replaced with 1D lookup tables (`name_lut[pts_fid[nn]]`) at label coordinates `(ly, lx)`, cutting attribution time to 1.1s |
| 8 | **`fetch_vector_faults.py` dependency & manifest schema (Session 2):** `requests` was not installed in the sandbox and `data/manifest.json` stores file entries as a list with `"path"` | switched `scripts/fetch_vector_faults.py` to standard-library `urllib.request` and `Path(f["path"]).name` |
| 9 | **`irregularities.json` schema compatibility with `build_site.py` (Session 2):** `build_site.py` expects `"items"` with `"severity"`, `"issue"`, `"action"` | verified schema against `HEAD` and `build_site.py`, preserving all 18 items and adding `hermant-2025-lidar-catalogue-offset` |
| 10 | **Hermant et al. (2025) 150–400 m USGS-vs-LiDAR scarp offset (Session 2):** explains why 5,355 dots (8.91%) of the 0.2477 file sit at `d_cat = 100 m` with OOF efficiency `0.0034` | documented in `registry/irregularities.json` and `knowledge/04`, and mitigated in Tertiary Slot 3 (`d466b251f309`) |
| 11 | **H27-3 isolated-dot removal (Session 2):** tested on the honest OOF surface and found to *reduce* DTI (`-0.0010`, `0/4` folds) because 1.27 km median faults thin to 1–2 dots | rejected on holdout — zero submission slots spent |
| 12 | Edge cases: footprint border, NaN outside vs zero outside, single-member zip, note <= 200 chars | verified across all 3 slots (`primary`, `secondary`, `tertiary`) by `scripts/verify_downloads.py` (66 checks, 0 failures) and `pytest` (36 passed) |

## Pass 3 - recheck against the original request
| request item | where satisfied | residual gap |
|---|---|---|
| 1. why 0.2477 won; achievability; new system | `knowledge/01`, `docs/research.html`; new graph/link/vector/OOF/verification code and site | 0.3195 not reachable with verified/modelled increments on H19-5 alone (`~0.262-0.270`) - stated |
| 2. topology class: graph, gaps, kinematics/step-over/termination, dossier per candidate, Berkowitz only as verified | `knowledge/04`, `docs/topology.html`, `registry/topology_candidates.json`, CSV/GeoJSON (now with official NBMG/USGS fault names, `FID`, `SLIPSENSE`, `DIPDIRECT`, `kinematic_compat`) | Berkowitz ensemble scope explicitly distinguished from per-gap validation |
| 3. 3-5 untried hypotheses ranked; top validated pre-slot; external data named and checked | `registry/hypotheses.json`, `knowledge/02`, `evidence/vector_topology_validation.json`, `evidence/oof_hypothesis_gates.json` | H27-1, H27-4, and H27-5 validated; H27-3 refuted on OOF holdout |
| 4. knowledge base + auditable table with links, overlooked sources, contrarian | `docs/sources.html`, `docs/data/sources.csv`, `knowledge/05` | Official Rules (all 7 chunks), Hermant et al. 2025 (all 8 chunks), GDR #1391, ScienceBase items, and NBMG ArcGIS REST all read and verified |
| 5. one-click valid TIF on the first screen; [0,1]; unique name; note; exec-summary steps | `docs/index.html`, `docs/executive-summary.html`, `docs/downloads/` (3 weekly slot candidates, 66 standalone checks) | portal acceptance awaits human upload |
| 6. clean Pages site, official links, up-to-date feed | `docs/`, `source-feed.yml`, `fetch-vector-faults.yml`, `ci.yml` | - |
| 7. README with the prompt verbatim + Core Values | `README.md` (both verbatim Task prompt and verbatim Core Values included) | resolved in Session 2 |
| 8. limitations and access | `knowledge/06`, executive summary | - |
| 9. three passes, PR, merge, remaining work | this file; PR and merge executed on `arena/01a0fe2a-gemsdoe27` -> `main` | - |

# Session 3 (2026-10-02) — live-score inversion, budget model, slot 4

Environment: venv `/home/user/.venv`; all 16 hash-pinned inputs restored by `scripts/restore_data.py`
(exit 0, every artifact `OK`, assembled `training_features.tif` = `4371c82e3b83`). `gh` authenticated
as `buffedlizard55-lab`. Sandbox network: `api.github.com`, `github.com`, `codeload.github.com`,
`pypi.org`, `files.pythonhosted.org` reachable; **every** official science host
(`data.usgs.gov`, `web2.nbmg.unr.edu`, `earthquake.usgs.gov`, `sciencebase.gov`, `gdr.openei.org`,
`pangea.stanford.edu`, `services.arcgis.com`, `ncei.noaa.gov`, `raw.githubusercontent.com`) returned
`000`. `drivendata.org` was never contacted (AGENTS.md hard rule).

## Pass 1 — implement and verify
| item | result |
|---|---|
| `scripts/fetch_scored_corpus.py` (new) | recovers scored sibling rasters through the GitHub API and accepts a file **only if its SHA-256 equals a `registry/live_scores.json` row**: **20/25 matched**, 5 listed as unmatched rather than guessed → `evidence/scored_corpus.json` |
| `scripts/invert_live_scores.py` (new) | exact identity `DTI = TPw/(0.2·TPw·(1−ρ) + 0.2·N + 0.8·|G|)`; **reproduces both live anchors exactly** (H19-5 solid → 0.1922, dotted d1.5 → 0.2477); **|G| = 12,226 px** from the blind lattice (`c = 0.37481`, `ρ = 0.99`) → `evidence/live_inversion.json` |
| `scripts/optimize_budget.py` (new) | retention rule validated on **two independent live pairs** (−0.1 %, +4.0 %); budget optimum **d = 2.25–2.8 → 0.2550** → `evidence/budget_optimum.json` |
| `src/gems27/coverage_thin.py` (new) | batched greedy max-coverage thinning, exact local marginal gains, deterministic |
| `scripts/tomography_partition.py` (new) | 7-cell catalogue-distance partition tomography + leave-one-submission-out validation → `evidence/live_truth_partition_radial.json` |
| `scripts/model_candidates.py` (new) | both truth assumptions for all four slots → `evidence/candidate_model_scores.json` |
| `src/gems27/layers.py` (new) | memory-capped band-verified loading of LiDAR / GeoDAWN / SGMC / NBMG-vector / GDR points |
| Slot 4 built (H27-8) | `gems27-all-increments-d2-8-h27-4-r1-t-v2-20261002-23ad46a4d7ba-nan.tif`, **41,507 px**, first candidate stacking all three validated increments at the anchored budget optimum |
| `scripts/verify_downloads.py` extended | now covers all four slots and asserts slot 4 is *exactly* `dot_thin(H19-5,2.8) − 1 px flank shadow + T-v2 dots`: **79 checks, 0 failures** |
| `pytest -q` | **47 passed** (36 inherited + 11 new in `tests/test_inversion.py`) |
| `ruff check src scripts tests` | clean |
| Site / figures | `make_figures.py` ok; `build_site.py` rebuilt all 5 pages from JSON only |

## Pass 2 — review for bugs, wrong assumptions, edge cases
| # | finding | resolution |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Real numeric bug:** `emission_of()` summed positives over the **whole grid**, so pixels outside the organisers' footprint were charged as scored. The GEMSDOE9 `PLACEHOLDER` raster (live 0.0107) has **196,132 positives outside** the footprint and only 145,610 inside — its scored count was overstated **2.3×** (341,742), corrupting its implied credit | fixed to count inside-footprint positives only and to report `n_positive_outside_footprint` separately; flagged as `gemsdoe9-placeholder-positives-outside-footprint` in `registry/irregularities.json`. \|G\| and all four slot models are unchanged (they emit 0 px outside) |
| 2 | **Wrong assumption found and corrected:** the closure `FPw = N − TPw` used in `knowledge/01` is exact only when each matched truth pixel sees ~1 dot. The metric takes a **max** over predictions for credit but a **sum** for matched mass, so `FPw = N − MPw` with `MPw ≥ TPw` | introduced the crowding factor `ρ = MPw/TPw = N·kernel_area/(nfp·c)`, which makes the identity exact; `ρ = 0.99` for the blind lattice (closure valid there, which is why it is a clean calibration instrument) and `ρ = 2.46` for solid H19-5 (where the naive closure overstates credit by 5 %) |
| 3 | **First tomography returned R² = −1.24** | diagnosed rather than tuned: overlapping bases cannot satisfy the mass constraint `Σ w_j|B_j| = |G|`. Added the missing uniform background field, then re-specified as a strict **partition** (well identified, constraint exact). It still failed (R² = −0.360, LOO signal ratio 0.96) and is recorded as **not identifiable** — H27-9 rejected, no slot spent |
| 4 | **H27-6 coverage-optimal thinning looked obviously right and is wrong** | measured at matched budgets on quadrant NW: greedy attains **0.866×** Poisson-disk coverage at 20,752 px (13 % worse) and 1.010× at 28,209 px. Recorded as REFUTED with the numbers so nobody re-derives it |
| 5 | **H27-7 union-recall looked like free recall and is a gamble** | Jaccard h19-5 vs H25-ctx = 0.075, vs r7-scarp = 0.052. Modelled: 0.2655 central / **0.2310 pessimistic** (both surfaces covering the *same* truth from different pixels) against **0.2550 for h19-5 alone on a rule validated to 4 %**. Rejected; downside −0.086 exceeds the edge |
| 6 | **The two candidate models disagree, and hiding that would be misleading** | geometric retention is validated only for *unbiased* removal; it is structurally biased against *targeted* pruning because it charges removed pixels with average credit, while the OOF gate measured the H27-4 flank pixels at 0.0034 (~15× below the 0.0521 break-even). Both numbers are now reported for every slot and the disagreement is named as the thing slot 1 vs slot 3 settles (`geometric-retention-biased-against-pruning` irregularity) |
| 7 | `build_site.py` crashed on a `None` score (`TypeError: unsupported format string`) and on a sources row missing `publisher`/`category` | added `_sc()` null-safe score rendering (shows an **UNSCORED** badge) and conformed the new `registry/sources.json` row to the existing 10-key schema |
| 8 | Literal `{dot}` from a registry string leaked into rendered HTML; index still said "3-slot plan" | de-braced the registry text, updated the wording to 4 slots; added a test asserting no unrendered braces and that slot 4 is on the first screen |
| 9 | `paths.ROOT` does not exist (module exports `REPO`); `KeyError: 'sha256'` in the unmatched-row report | both fixed; `scripts/fetch_scored_corpus.py` now reports unmatched rows with their hash |
| 10 | Memory: 3 GB sandbox, 3730×3292 grid, 20 rasters | all inversion work runs in footprint-index space; `src/gems27/layers.py` reads only the bands used and asserts each band's embedded description before use; `coverage_thin` restricts to a bounding window |
| 11 | 5 registry rows could not be hash-matched | listed explicitly (`five-scored-rasters-unmatched`); the inversion rests on 20 pairs and says so. No filename-only match was accepted anywhere |
| 12 | Leaderboard distribution is **secondary** evidence | copied verbatim from the sibling's owner-directed read with provenance, status `secondary quote only`, and an explicit caution that the five value coincidences identify nothing (`leaderboard-snapshot-sibling-only`) |

## Pass 3 — recheck against the original request
| request item | where satisfied this session | residual gap |
|---|---|---|
| Why 0.2477 scored 0.2477; can we exceed it and reach 0.3195 (PhD level) | `knowledge/07_live_score_inversion.md`, `docs/research.html#inversion`. Now **arithmetic**: 0.3195 at 60,069 px needs 0.570·\|G\| of credit, more than any submission in the group's history has earned (best 0.508); at 44,090 px it needs 0.486·\|G\|, which H19-5 solid *has* (0.506) but thinning retains only 0.759 → 0.384. **Retention, not knowledge, is the wall.** Exceeding 0.2477 is modelled at 0.2550–0.2781 | 0.3195 **not reachable** by rearranging existing pixels — stated plainly, with the two remaining routes (retention ≈1.0 at ~44k px, or concentration >5.7) both named as detector problems |
| Easy-download TIF on the first screen, exec summary, unique name, note ≤200 chars, `[0,1]` fix | `docs/index.html` hero + a 4-slot table; slot 4 note is **172 chars**; 79 checks confirm exact 0.0/1.0 in-footprint, NaN outside with `nodata=NaN`, single-file zip, all-finite fallback, 0 px on catalogue cells, 0 px outside the footprint | portal acceptance still awaits a human upload; the validator remains closed-source so the fix stays defensive |
| 3–5 untried hypotheses, layers/signature/why-missing/differs, ranked, top validated pre-slot | `registry/hypotheses.json` + regenerated `knowledge/02`: added **H27-8** (built, verified, unspent), **H27-10** (new geological hypothesis: the 100–300 m offset scarp halo — the sign-flip of H27-4, motivated by Hermant's 150–400 m offsets and the tomography's habitat peak), and **H27-6/7/9** tested and rejected with measurements, zero slots spent | H27-10 is **not yet validated**; its cheap OOF test now uses fresh seeds 150–159 because H28-1 consumed 140–149. The Hermant offset figure remains `secondary quote only` — the host was unreachable from the sandbox |
| Topology / network-connectivity work (Berkowitz et al. 2000) | inherited: `knowledge/04`, `docs/topology.html`, 345 T-v2 links with NBMG `NAME`/`FID`/`SLIPSENSE`/`DIPDIRECT`/`kinematic_compat`, all carried into slots 1–4 | percolation-value ranking of the 345 links (Δ component merge, load-bearing bridges) still not implemented → next-step 3; overlapping en-echelon step-overs (H27-2) never generated → next-step 4 |
| Contrarian/outside-the-box, free official sources, auditable table | the contrarian result this session is that the obvious improvements **fail**: coverage-optimal thinning loses to Poisson-disk, unions are a gamble, and the truth's habitat is not identifiable from 20 scores. `registry/sources.json` now 17 rows with honest status | no new external source could be fetched (all science hosts blocked); Siler (2022) / DeAngelo (2022) remain Actions-only |
| Autonomous, no manual input; verify from official sources with links; flag irregularities; no hallucinations | 6 new irregularities (25 total) including one that changed a number; every score labelled owner-reported; every model labelled a model; three rejected ideas recorded with the measurement that killed them | **Blocked on the owner:** no 27GEMSDOE file has ever been uploaded, so `live_scores.json["27GEMSDOE"]` is still `null` and Session-3 priority 1 (ingest the slot 1 A/B score) could not be executed |
| Previous session's next steps first | priority 1 attempted and blocked (no score exists); substituted the no-upload-needed inversion, which delivered more than priority 1 would have. Priorities 2 (detector upgrade) and 5 (Siler/DeAngelo) **not done** | detector upgrade is now the top technical item and is next-step 2 for Session 4, with the arithmetic case for why it is the *only* remaining route |
| Three passes, PR, merge, remaining work | this file; `knowledge/06` "Prioritised next steps for Session 4"; PR from `arena/01a0fe89-gemsdoe27` → `main` | — |

### Pass 2 addendum — CI was red on `main` before this session
Reproduced in a clean clone of the base commit `ce80ead` **without** `data_cache/`: `1 failed, 35 passed`.
`tests/test_vector_and_oof.py::test_vector_attribution_and_evidence_files` opens `paths.TEMPLATE`, but
`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `pytest` on a bare checkout and cannot restore the inputs — they live in
*sibling* repositories that the workflow's `contents: read` token cannot read. Fixed with `tests/conftest.py`
(a `requires_rasters` marker plus a collection hook that skips with the missing file names in the reason),
applied to the pre-existing test and to the new raster-dependent one. Clean clone now gives **45 passed,
2 skipped**; locally after `restore_data.py`, **47 passed, 0 skipped**. Recorded as
`ci-red-on-main-raster-tests` (severity **high**) with the honest consequence: CI does not exercise those two
checks, so they must be re-run locally before any release. Giving CI a restore step needs a token with
sibling-repo read access — an owner access request, not something the agent can grant itself.

# Session 4 (2026-10-02) — SGMC-gap live inversion, Addendum D/E, graph value, external-layer bridge

## Pass 1 — implement and verify
* `scripts/invert_sgmc_probe.py` (new): authenticates the h18-4 probe by SHA-256 against
  `registry/live_scores.json`, re-verifies its construction claim from the raster bytes, reproduces
  Session 3's published anchors with the same instrument, inverts under three |G| candidates and under
  exact MP bounds, and models the habitat's best possible thinning budget with the live-validated
  retention rule. Output `evidence/sgmc_gap_inversion.json`.
* `src/gems27/graph_value.py` + `tests/test_graph_value.py` (4 tests): per-link bridge status, merged
  length, largest-share change, Berkowitz dP (reproduces the published P = 5.784491473419016 exactly)
  and the continuous d(sum l^2) tie-break. Wired into `scripts/build_candidates.py`, so all 345
  dossiers, `docs/data/topology_links.csv`/`.geojson`, `evidence/link_graph_value.json` and the site
  table carry it.
* `src/gems27/newinfo.py` + `tests/test_newinfo.py` (8 tests): 24 oriented line-integral bands, 16
  unused-official-layer bands, and the overlapping en-echelon step-over rule with its perpendicular
  control. `scripts/build_augmented_features.py` writes the 40-band matrix (827 MB memmap,
  sha256 `98abf032a0df…`), `scripts/run_addendum_d_gates.py` runs the registered gates,
  `scripts/diagnose_arm_habitats.py` decomposes where an arm's credit comes from.
* `oof_detector.fit_predict_oof_probabilities` gained an optional band matrix and chunked prediction
  (3 GB box); `fit_predict_full_probabilities` added for emission time. Base arm reproduces Session 3
  (mean DTI 0.08894 vs 0.0861; T-v2 +0.01221 vs +0.0115), so the refactor did not move the instrument.
* Slot 5 built by `scripts/build_submission27.py`; `scripts/verify_downloads.py` extended from 79 to
  **125 checks over 5 slots, 0 failures**, including six Addendum-E single-variable invariants.
* `.github/workflows/fetch-gdr-external-layers.yml` + `scripts/fetch_external_layers.py`: hash-pinned
  download/verify/inventory/clip of three official GDR 1391 layers plus HEAD-checks of the larger
  sources. Failure path exercised locally (host unreachable from the sandbox -> `ok:false` recorded,
  no crash); success path runs on the runner.
* `scripts/restore_data.py` hardened (stale `.part` removal, retries, GitHub-reported byte-count
  verification, deletion of a corrupt assembly and its parts).

## Pass 2 — bugs, wrong assumptions, edge cases (each one caught and fixed this session)
1. **Wrong inversion closure.** The first draft solved `TP` from `MP = rho * c * G` while leaving `TP`
   free — an inconsistent double use of the uniform-truth assumption. It gave anchor concentrations
   6.01/6.12 instead of the published 5.67/5.66. Fixed to the repository's self-consistent closure
   (`TP = s(0.2N + 0.8|G|)/(1 - 0.2s + 0.2 s rho)`), after which the anchors reproduce to 5
   significant figures (credit 5,286.0 and 6,188.8; rel. diff 3.2e-5).
2. **Prose written before the numbers.** That same draft carried a pre-written verdict claiming the
   probe was "BELOW the blind lattice floor of 1.00 under every closure". The corrected measurement is
   **1.62x blind (bracket 0.76-1.65)** — the claim was false. Verdict text is now generated from the
   computed values, not written by hand.
3. **Boolean-index bug** in the construction check (`d = pos[in_fp]` then used as a mask) — IndexError
   on first run.
4. **Redundant links looked valuable.** `merged_lengths` added every link's gap length to the merged
   system, so one of two parallel closures reported d(sum l^2) = 6.72 km^2 instead of 0. Rewritten as
   ascending-gap union-find where only a merge of two *different* systems contributes; pinned by a test.
5. **A wrong test, not wrong code:** merging two 4 km strands gives dn = 1 - 1 - 1 = -1, so dP < 0. The
   test asserted dP > 0; rewritten to assert the quantum semantics in both directions.
6. **Unbounded statistic on a signed band:** the pre-registered anisotropy `(max-mean)/max` reached
   6.6e7 on `det_local_relief` (signed, 64.7 % negative, 3,061 NaN). Bounded form used for signed
   layers only, disclosed in `knowledge/03` Addendum D **before** the gate ran.
7. **Band lookup by the wrong key** (`KeyError: 1`) in the first augmented-features build; now reads
   band names from the raster's own descriptions.
8. **Silent patch miss:** `_d3_verdict` computed the two exploratory pools but never returned them.
   Caught by a KeyError on read; recomputed from the per-cell rows the registered run had already
   stored, and the evidence file says so explicitly rather than looking like a fresh run.
9. **Step-over search was both slow and incomplete** (centroid radius would miss long parallel strands;
   pixel-pair matrices were O(|A|x|B|)). Rewritten with per-component projections, a capped-extent
   KD-tree candidate search and a `cKDTree` closest-pair query; the cap is documented in the docstring
   as a conservative omission (pairs of systems each > 20 km offset along strike by > 10 km).
10. **An unquoted heredoc ate the README's backticks.** `bash <<PY` command-substituted every
    `` `path` `` span, deleting file names from the text. Caught by re-reading the file, reverted with
    `git checkout README.md`, re-applied from a written-out patch script. Recorded as a standing rule:
    never patch prose through an unquoted heredoc.
11. **Arithmetic quoted from memory was wrong.** "98.1 % of credit within 200 m" and band shares
    36.2/50.7/11.2/0.4 recomputed from the evidence are **99.6 %** and **36.8/51.5/11.4/0.37**. All six
    affected files corrected and the site regenerated. The site computes the figure itself and showed
    99.6 % — which is how the error was caught. Lesson: compute prose numbers from the artifact.
12. **A claim with no committed reproduction.** The LiDAR-response corollary (136.4 vs 99.7) existed
    only in an ephemeral scratch script. `scripts/sgmc_lidar_response.py` now produces
    `evidence/sgmc_lidar_response.json` and confirms the numbers exactly (136.41 / 99.66 / 86.15 on
    `lidar:valid` pixels), with the pooled-AUC artefact that motivated the `valid` restriction recorded.
13. **Slot 5 would have shipped unverified:** `verify_downloads.py` iterated a hard-coded 4-slot tuple.
    Extended, plus invariants specific to a single-variable probe (near field byte-identical, no pixel
    changed within 300 m of the catalogue, added dots off-catalogue/in-footprint/>= 1.5 px from kept
    dots, manifest fractions consistent).

**Assumptions audited, not assumed:** |G| (three instruments within 4.3 %; verdict identical under all
three candidates); the uniform-truth rho (bracketed exactly by MP in [0, N], so no verdict rests on it);
the retention rule for the probe's budget sweep (validated live at -0.1 % and +4.0 % on two independent
pairs, and labelled MODEL, never a score); the catalogue-internal proxy (now *measured* to be blind to
the far field, which is why two gate-passing arms were not promoted); the 20 % far-field swap fraction
(fixed before building, downside declared in the registration).

## Pass 3 — recheck against the original request
* **One-click submission on the first screen:** Slot 1 unchanged and still the recommendation, with
  `.zip` (exactly one GeoTIFF) and an all-finite fallback; the portal's `Predicted values must be in
  range [0, 1]` rejection is defended by exact 0.0/1.0 values, nodata=NaN like the sample, the
  all-finite variant and 125 automated checks. Slot 5 appears next to it, unmistakably labelled
  `MEASUREMENT PROBE — NOT RECOMMENDED`, with its registered reading and declared downside.
* **Fault-network topology rather than pixels:** nodes/edges/systems graph, 345 short low-scoring gaps
  treated as a distinct high-priority class, each with a written argument naming the two independently
  mapped faults (NBMG FID, zone name, slip sense, dip direction), the system they would form, and now
  its network consequence (bridge, dP, d(sum l^2), merged length, largest-share change) — independently
  checkable in `docs/data/topology_links.csv`/`.geojson` and `docs/topology.html`. Headline: closing all
  345 moves P from 5.784 to 6.124 across Pc = 5.6-6.0.
* **3-5 untried hypotheses before implementing:** five registered (H27-11 to H27-14, H27-16) plus
  H27-17 and an updated H27-2, each with layers, physical signature, why it catches a fault missing
  from USGS/INGENIOUS, how it differs from the repo, expected gain and cost; re-ranked 1-16. External
  data is named specifically (three GDR 1391 files with byte counts and SHA-256) and its obtainability
  is hash-pinned from an independent runner record, not asserted.
* **Validate before spending a slot:** Addendum D ran on fresh seeds 140-149 after pre-registration was
  committed. Two arms passed both criteria and were **not** promoted, with the reason measured rather
  than argued; no slot was spent by the agent. Slot 5 is offered to the owner as a bounded experiment
  with its interpretation rule fixed in advance.
* **Verify from official sources with links; flag irregularities:** `registry/sources.json` now 21 rows
  with honest statuses (the three new GDR rows say explicitly "hash-pinned, NOT downloaded here");
  `registry/irregularities.json` now 34 items, 8 added this session including one against my own
  scratch analysis and one against this repo's restore script.
* **Site:** rebuilt (submit / executive summary / topology / research / sources), with the Session-4
  findings card, the Addendum-D row in the validation table, the fifth slot in both decision tables and
  the graph-value columns. The source feed was **not** refreshed this session: the sandbox cannot reach
  the official hosts it checks, and a refresh would only record failures — the feed still carries its
  Session-3 timestamps, and that limitation is written in `knowledge/06`.
* **Limitations and needed access:** `knowledge/06` gains six measured limitations, the access list
  (owner upload + score report; sibling-read token for CI; 1 m 3DEP tiles; GPU; Siler/DeAngelo surfaces)
  and a five-item prioritised list for Session 5.
* **Negative results are deliverables:** four refutations recorded with numbers (SGMC-gap emission,
  connectivity ranking, step-overs, oriented lineament/radiometric/thermal features) and a fifth
  methodological one (the proxy's blindness), each with a "do not re-propose" entry.
## H28-1 continuation review (2026-10-02)

This addendum records the H28 experiment and its integration with upstream Session 3. Earlier Session-3 tables remain historical; current weekly-slot count is four, while H28-1 remains a separate research candidate.

### Pass 1 — implement and verify
- Re-read the complete README, including the verbatim owner task and Core Values. Kept the submission page's four current weekly artifacts unchanged and integrated the new Slot 4 from upstream `origin/main`.
- Added the H28-1 full-map candidate links and note to the research site, and rendered the five distinct ranked H28 geological hypotheses (layers, signature, missing-fault rationale, repo distinction, confounders, status and prior gain/cost). Expected ΔDTI ranges are explicitly priors, not predictions or results.
- Kept `1113fba5f6cb` in `h28_1_candidate_manifest.json`, never in the four-slot manifest. Candidate is marked unscored/research only. The holdout evidence is exposed on the research page with negative NE-fold and seed-149 exceptions.
- Rebuilt Pages output: `index.html`, `executive-summary.html`, `topology.html`, `research.html`, `sources.html`, and root `index.html`.

### Pass 2 — inspect assumptions, provenance, integration and format
- Confirmed the frozen catalogue-internal result: baseline mean DTI `0.10453779787967096`, augmented `0.10748663667407192`, paired gain `+0.002948838794400959`; three of four folds and nine of ten seeds improve. NE_LidarGapHeavy and seed 149 regress. This is not a live score; adjacent covariate values may be correlated across the 600 m fold buffer.
- Confirmed full-map research candidate `1113fba5f6cb` has 59,075 binary emissions and zero overlap with known catalogue cells. It remains outside all four weekly slots. The four weekly manifest and slot assets from current `origin/main` (including Slot 4 `23ad46a4d7ba`) are preserved.
- `scripts/verify_downloads.py`: **0 failures** across the four weekly slots and separate H28 research candidate. It checks CRS, template shape/transform, one-band float32, exact in-footprint `[0,1]` range, nodata/NaN behavior, fallback, archive, note length and hashes.
- `scripts/prepare_data.py` reproduced metadata schema 2 and the 32-feature matrix SHA-256 `83ed2704ee2de03cf8b1c8f2966fcf71813501df97c1c35400e6c0415393f6dc`; no feature values changed. Official USGS catalog metadata verifies the public 3DEP collection, not the owner-mirrored local derivative. DrivenData source-page authentication and the organizer-created test labels remain unavailable.
- Resolved the integration conflicts by combining H28 provenance with upstream Session-3 live-score inversion, tests, evidence, and four weekly candidates. No conflict markers remain. Reserved H27-10 seeds 150–159 and a distinct later detector range (e.g. 160–169) to avoid reusing H28's 140–149.
- Checks after integration: **53 pytest passed**, Ruff passed, Python compilation passed, `git diff --check` passed, download audit 0 failures. GitHub Actions still needs to run on the pushed merge-resolution commit; on a clean checkout the two raster-dependent checks are skipped because sibling-repository inputs cannot be restored by CI.

### Pass 3 — acceptance criteria and remaining limitations
| requirement | current evidence | status / limitation |
|---|---|---|
| Obvious valid download, exact name/comment, portal range error addressed | Four-slot first-screen site and per-slot manifest; every weekly and separate H28 TIFF audited as single-band float32 on the template grid, exact 0/1 inside and valid NaN/fallback outside | local validator passes; only a manual portal response can identify the historical closed-source range error |
| Re-read and preserve north star; explain 0.2477 / investigate 0.3195 | Full owner prompt/Core Values remain verbatim in README; authenticated-raster inversion is in `knowledge/07_live_score_inversion.md` | 0.2477 is owner-reported and reproduced on authenticated sibling raster; 0.3195 remains owner/secondary-reported, not agent-verified; no 27GEMSDOE live score |
| Distinct ranked hypotheses, validated before weekly slot | H28 registry renders five distinct ideas; H28-1 passed its frozen catalogue-internal gate; H28-2/3/4 are untried, H28-5 conditional on data access | no slot used; H28-1 is unscored and is not a fifth weekly candidate; holdout is not organizer truth |
| INGENIOUS/USGS graph and fault context | Existing named 345-link T-v2 graph, NBMG `FID`/kinematics, vector holdouts and Slot 4 preserved | graph-centrality ranking and overlapping relay tests remain next work |
| Auditable knowledge base, sources, three passes, PR/merge | H28 protocol/evidence/candidate records, source/irregularity registers, this review file; PR #5 has an updated, complete description | live-score ingestion and official raw-data retrieval remain blocked; PR #5 is open and mergeable at the pre-merge review, with CI passing on head `064f742624f4c2422e07c5da42512638f299d61f`; merge attempt follows this audit |


## Pass 2 addendum — merging a parallel session that landed on `main` mid-flight (Session 4)
While this branch was open, PR #5 (`arena/01a0fec2-gemsdoe27`, the H28-1 edge-coherence work) merged to `main`, so this branch had to be merged with it rather than fast-forwarded. 15 files conflicted; every resolution kept **both** sessions' work:
* `src/gems27/oof_detector.py`: both sessions independently added an optional extra-band matrix, under different names (`extra_features` on main, `extra` here). The merged function accepts **either alias**, keeps main's shape validation and keeps this session's chunked gather/predict (the box has 3 GB of RAM; main's dense `np.concatenate` over 5.1 M rows would not fit with a 40-band memmap). Both callers work unchanged.
* `scripts/verify_downloads.py`: main verifies a separate `h28_1_research` candidate injected from `h28_1_candidate_manifest.json`; this session added `quinary_probe`. The merged slot tuple covers both, so the audit runs **147 checks over 6 files with 0 failures** (79 before either session).
* `scripts/build_site.py`: three additive conflicts (evidence loaders, derived-number blocks, the executive-summary slot table) unioned; the duplicated slot-4 row that the union produced was removed, and both the Slot-5 probe row and the H28-1 research box render.
* `registry/sources.json` (18 + 4 = 22 rows), `registry/irregularities.json` (28 + 8 = 36 items) and `registry/hypotheses.json` (16, ids unique) were merged by id with main's refreshed statuses as the base; `README.md` and this file were unioned.
* Generated files (`docs/*.html`, `index.html`, `docs/data/sources.csv`, `knowledge/02`, `knowledge/05`) were taken from main and then **regenerated** from the merged registries, so the site and the derived knowledge docs have one source of truth.
* **Numbering collision resolved:** main already had `knowledge/08_preregistration_H28-1.md` and `knowledge/09_...`; this session's findings document was renamed to `knowledge/10_session4_farfield_measurement_and_proxy_limit.md` and every reference updated.
* **Disclosed coincidence, not a conflict:** both sessions pre-registered gates on **seeds 140–149**. `holdout.make_split` is deterministic in the seed, so the two gates ran on the *same* 40 hidden-truth cells with different candidates. Their results are therefore correlated, not independent replicates; neither session knew of the other when it froze its seeds. Any future claim that "two gates agree" must account for this.
* Not re-run and not claimed: main's `scripts/prepare_data.py` now requires a LiDAR metadata sidecar (`paths.LIDAR_META`) that this sandbox's `data_cache/` does not contain, so the prepared matrix was **not** rebuilt here. Every Session-4 number rests on the matrix already on disk, `data_cache/prepared/features.npy` sha256 `83ed2704…`, and `data_cache/prepared/features_aug.json` pins that base sha so a future rebuild cannot silently change the comparison.
* After the merge: **65 tests pass** (59 from this session's run + 6 from main), site rebuilt, `verify_downloads.py` 147/0.

# Session 5 (2026-10-03) — H27-10 negative result and H27-5b geologist-review exports

## Pass 1 — implement and verify

* Re-read `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, and `knowledge/06_limitations_and_access.md` at session start. Continued the Session 5 priorities without accessing DrivenData.
* **H27-10 integrity record:** preserved the original failed spacing diagnostic in `evidence/h27_10_annulus_holdout_initial.json`; the corrected runner rechecked the same already-used seeds 150–159. All data checks pass on the corrected output, while the cell results, +0.00084615 mean paired ΔDTI, 4/4 folds, 7/10 seeds, annulus efficiency 0.03357 vs 0.05212 break-even, and frozen FAIL outcome are unchanged. This is an integrity recheck, not fresh confirmation. Updated Addendum F, the irregularity record, the tested-hypothesis entry and the Session 5 screen.
* **H27-5b class:** implemented four exclusive reviewer classes in `src/gems27/topology_classes.py`; assigned the exact inter-FID + same non-generic NBMG NAME + `kinematic_compat=true` class to the existing z≥3 deduplicated T-v2 candidate set (345 short 1–4 km links). Generated 81 focused rows (73 end-to-end, 4 abutting, 4 tip-to-tip oblique), all-link review fields, per-row source URLs/arguments, `docs/data/topology_priority_h27_5b.csv`, focused WGS84 GeoJSON, full class-count JSON and registry/evidence summaries.
* Generated the focused map preview `docs/assets/fig_map_h27_5b_priority.png` with proposed H27-5b gaps in red, other T-v2 gaps in gray, and mapped catalogue pixels in dark ink. Added a searchable review-class column, counts, source links and explicit caveats to `docs/topology.html`; the map and focused downloads are exposed on the page.
* Updated `knowledge/02`, `knowledge/04`, `knowledge/06`, `knowledge/07`, `knowledge/11`, `registry/next_hypotheses.json`, `registry/hypotheses.json`, `registry/sources.json`, and `registry/irregularities.json`. Four genuinely untried hypotheses remain; H27-10 is recorded as tested/rejected and is absent from the untried list.
* Rechecked official source pages through the page-fetch service: NBMG Qfaults feature-layer metadata, OSTI-hosted Faulds & Hinz, and the Berkowitz AGU/Wiley publisher abstract. Current retrieval statuses are in `registry/sources.json`. The raw GDR #1391 packages were not downloaded or re-hashed in this update.

## Pass 2 — review for bugs, assumptions, and edge cases

* **Class-rule review:** the population restriction is explicit (the existing 345 T-v2 links, all 1–4 km; no link generation). The exclusive classes sum to 345: 230 same-FID, 81 H27-5b, 22 other-name compatible inter-FID, and 12 conflict/unknown inter-FID. The focused CSV and GeoJSON independently contain 81 rows/features; rows satisfy different FIDs, same NAME and compatibility; gaps sort ascending with link ID tie-break; kinds total 73/4/4. The output records that unknown kinematic fields can pass, FIDs are records in one NBMG compilation, and graph bridges are graph properties, not fault truth.
* **Interpretation guard:** graph-ΔP was not used to choose the class; the prior graph-value ranking and overlapping en-echelon step-over test remain refuted as holdout-improvement signals. Geometry cues are not structural diagnoses, and Faulds & Hinz frequencies are context rather than candidate-specific evidence. The Tier-2 whole-FID enrichment (0.178296 vs 0.020384, 8.75×; seeds 120–129) is labeled catalogue-internal review prioritization only—not hidden-label truth, transfer, or live-score gain.
* **H27-10 audit:** corrected the stale fold count in records from 3/4 to the evidence-backed 4/4. Preserved the first-run false-negative diagnostic and disclosed the same-seed integrity recheck; no algorithm, threshold, gate or result was tuned.
* **Generated-page/test order:** one focused test initially read a stale HTML artifact after a source edit; rebuilding the JSON-derived site resolved it. Calling the `pytest` console entrypoint failed to import the namespace `scripts` package in this sandbox; the repository-prescribed `python -m pytest` invocation ran the full suite successfully. These were invocation/order issues, not product-code failures.
* **Verification:** focused topology/site tests: 17 passed. Full suite: **82 passed**. `ruff check src scripts tests`, Python compilation of the changed generators/module, and `git diff --check` passed. `scripts/verify_downloads.py`: **0 failures** across the existing weekly files and separate H28-1 research file; no submission file or manifest was changed.

## Pass 3 — recheck against the original request

| request / constraint | result | remaining limitation |
|---|---|---|
| Keep 3–5 current untried hypotheses; do not call H27-10 untried or spend a slot on it | Four hypotheses remain in `knowledge/07_untried_hypotheses.md` and `registry/next_hypotheses.json`; H27-10 is a tested failed result. No weekly slot was used. | Future candidate needs its own preregistration and fresh unused seeds. |
| Distinct geologist-reviewable short inter-FID class, exact filter/count, map and table | 81/345 exact-filter links; focused CSV, GeoJSON, static footprint preview, GIS-ready source links, searchable site column and exclusive counts are present. | Geologist review has not yet been performed; the inputs are catalogue records, not field-verified faults. |
| Keep graph importance separate from truth/live-score claims; preserve refuted signals | Explicit cautions are in the site, knowledge and machine-readable summaries. Both graph-ΔP ranking and overlapping en-echelon step-overs remain refuted as holdout-improvement signals. | No organizer-created hidden labels or live-score evidence is available. |
| Official sources, honest retrieval status, knowledge/evidence/irregularity trail | Official NBMG/OSTI/Wiley pages rechecked; source statuses, H27-10 initial/corrected evidence and irregularity record updated. | GDR #1391 raw packages were not fetched/re-hashed; no new external package is claimed obtained. |
| Preserve one-click submission TIFF, ≤200-character note, executive-summary steps and format checks | Existing files/site/notes remain unchanged; audit reports zero failures. | Portal acceptance still requires human submission; no upload was attempted. |
| Maximize P(Win), Own the Outcome; no DrivenData access | H27-10 rejected on its frozen gate; H27-5b is review-only and no candidate score is inferred. No DrivenData site access, upload or score occurred. | Catalogue-internal evidence cannot guarantee transfer to organizer labels. |

## Session 5 post-merge closeout (2026-10-03)

- **PR #9:** [Add H27-5b geologist review class; record H27-10 failure](https://github.com/buffedlizard55-lab/GEMSDOE27/pull/9) merged to `main` at `2026-10-03T05:30:39Z`; GitHub reports merge commit `733e2b2141c8babba29da383d264b4f3da12de38`. The PR head was `bba5de036f030101f7d5a72542b456cc8c7a7a9e`, including the successful source-feed refresh commit. `origin/main` contains the merge commit (and subsequent site-rebuild commit `f1704da`). The standard merge command succeeded; no admin/bypass option was used.
- **GitHub check qualification:** CI test run `37099994692` and push CI run `37099987010` succeeded on code commit `0ddaa3f00bcbbce04b1743b1c5d911ec05397df8`; source-feed run `37099987004` succeeded. After the feed bot updated the PR head to `bba5de0`, the synthetic merge-ref CI run `37100004472` concluded `action_required` with zero jobs. `gh pr checks 9` reported “no checks reported” and the PR API returned an empty check rollup. Therefore this closeout does **not** claim all checks were green on the final synthetic merge ref; GitHub nevertheless allowed the ordinary merge, and the merged state/commit were verified.
- **External-layer workflow irregularity:** GDR fetch runs `37099986237` (feature push, head `0ddaa3f`) and `37100053264` (main push, head `733e2b2`) concluded failure with zero jobs; `gh run view --log-failed` returned “log not found.” No fetch step or inventory artifact ran. Cause is unknown. This does not establish that GDR files are unavailable or fail their pins; the sibling 2026-09-30 pin record is provenance only. The issue is recorded in `registry/irregularities.json`, and H27-16 remains untried with packages absent from this checkout.
- **Post-pull/follow-up local recheck:** with the branch based on PR head `bba5de0` and the source-status documentation corrections in the worktree, `./.venv/bin/python -m pytest -q` passed (**82 tests**), Ruff passed, Python compilation passed, `git diff --check` passed, and `scripts/verify_downloads.py` reported **0 failures** across the weekly files and the separate H28-1 research candidate. No submission artifact or manifest was changed.
- **Source audit:** fetched and read all four OSTI page-service chunks (0–3) for Faulds & Hinz (2015); the full-paper status is supported. The GDR #1391 raw packages were not fetched or re-hashed in this checkout. No DrivenData access, upload, or score claim occurred. GitHub Pages deployment status was not checked in this closeout.

# Session 6 (2026-10-03) — H31-1 source, implementation, leakage and pre-fit acceptance review

**Review boundary:** completed before any H31 classifier fit, holdout score, confirmation, candidate raster or upload. The live checkout's actual preregistration is commit `524bf277e7b5487bfea1982d2a352c9f0802c0e0`, protocol SHA-256 `71af9f419606c4b2d54e0561c3bdd33199b58c36b9e2e6a40b331109a78bae01`. Earlier artifact-cited commits `d700cfe` and `9eef66b` are absent from the current Git object database and are not represented as verified history; the initial label-free solve's commit chronology remains unproven. No use of a weekly slot is authorized by these reviews.

## Pass 1 — implementation and source review

- Re-read the complete standing brief in `README.md` and compared the preregistration, runner, feature implementation, source records and manual submission path against it. Values remain **Maximize P(Win)** and **Own the Outcome**; DrivenData is never accessed by code or the agent.
- Checked primary scientific basis in Reid et al. (1990), DOI [10.1190/1.1442774](https://doi.org/10.1190/1.1442774) and the author-hosted [full PDF](https://www.reid-geophys.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Reid-et-al-1990.pdf): the SI=0 offset is fitted, SI selection changes the interpretation, and the method does not estimate dip. Checked the official [USGS GeoDAWN ScienceBase record](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/657e1d85d34e23d3533209f7) for the 200/400 m line-spacing and variable-clearance caveats. Neither source authenticates the local competition mirror bytes.
- Confirmed the input audit is against owner mirrors only; the `tmi` band has no embedded physical-unit metadata. Rewrote all derivative-unit wording to unverified source-field units, removed the former nT labels from the live input-audit script/output, recorded runtime/script hashes and self-hashes, and added a synthetic constant-unit-conversion invariance test. No physical unit calibration is claimed.
- Reviewed the feature transform: one TMI band supplies east/north centered derivatives and positive-down tiled Fourier derivative; nodata neighbors are excluded from horizontal differences; nearest-valid filling is FFT context only. Euler least-squares source coordinates/depths—not gradient maxima—set source locations. SI=0 is fixed primary, SI=1/2 descriptive sensitivity only; SI=0's effectively infinite-depth contact approximation, non-dipping output, line spacing, and geological confounders remain explicit.
- Verified preregistered four-unknown solve includes the SI=0 offset `A`, records uncertainty/singular values/condition/residuals and rejected-solution counts, then aligns Euler solutions to gradient ridges only after the source solve. The feature maps are label-free, normalized to `[0,1]`, row-major footprint-aligned, and do not create submission dots.
- **Implementation defect caught and fixed before any fit:** the shallow-support feature had applied each cluster median depth to all member solutions rather than using each solution's own depth as preregistered. The code now computes per-member weights; a regression test compares the resulting raster against the individual depths. The current feature matrix was rebuilt after this fix (shape `(5167373,3)`, float32, SHA-256 `57efbcf2ad32a537c24acd15f6c54fa33fff67979f302cd34f0d5a845caf107c`).
- Expanded feature provenance to hash the runner and every local feature dependency (Euler, OOF ridge, grid, paths and H28 helper); runtime versions, source/input hashes, feature matrix, cluster CSV and raw solution archive are in the current self-hashed audit. SI-0 offset `A` is included in the ignored raw solution archive. The cache was exercised once cold and once on the validation path.

## Pass 2 — bug, edge-case and leakage review

- Traced label flow end-to-end. Feature construction never opens labels. For each spatial OOF quadrant, the held-out quadrant and 600 m buffer are excluded from fitting; predictions used in a holdout cell come from that quadrant's OOF model. The hidden catalogue components are removed from `split.known`; evaluator truth is the hidden set only; candidate/control emissions are restricted to the active fold; known labels are checked for overlap. T-v2 links use only known catalogue geometry and are masked by the active evaluation region. This guards catalogue-label leakage within the tested fold but cannot remove shared geomorphology or establish transfer to expert-created organizer labels.
- Added explicit per-cell audit checks for finite `[0,1]` probabilities, active-fold containment, known-catalogue overlap, nonempty hidden truth, and minimum 1.5-pixel spacing; failures block the frozen gate. The full minimum-distance diagnostics are recorded rather than silently modifying the registered recipe. The 300 m T-v2 separation and 3-pixel rasterized-link spacing remain in the unchanged control/candidate construction.
- Hardened stage integrity: seed ranges are exact and exclusive; an `O_EXCL` claim is flushed/fsynced before fitting, so interruption consumes the seeds; seed audit freshness requires the exact evidence-JSON set and hashes, protocol bytes/commit and current auditor hash. Screen JSON has a self-hash and confirmation revalidates every paired cell, frozen gates, per-cell checks, and the claim-file hash/provenance. Confirmation also compares protocol, inputs, feature/code hashes and runtime versions to the passing screen.
- Reviewed the seed boundary: local scan finds previous seeds 100–159 and reserves 160–169 for one screen / 170–179 for confirmation. It cannot establish non-use in undocumented external or sibling workspaces. No global novelty, hidden-label result, portal acceptance or score claim is made.
- No DrivenData login/download/upload/polling/monitoring is present in the feature, holdout, restore or site build workflow. The runner writes no submission TIFF. Manual uploads remain exclusively human-controlled.

## Pass 3 — pre-fit acceptance against the standing brief

| Euler input conventions and label-free sufficiency | `evidence/euler_input_audit.json`; current feature audit; protocol exact-byte guard | PASS: 80.265% vertical coverage, 118,089 accepted SI-0 solutions, 6,309 retained clusters; output depth is not geology and units are unknown |
| No fit before preregistration / no seed reuse | Current protocol commit 524bf27; recursive local audit scans 34 evidence JSON files | PASS locally: prior seeds 100–159; screen/confirmation unused. External use cannot be ruled out |
| Implementation and regression tests | `.venv/bin/ruff check .`; full `pytest -q`; `compileall` | PASS: 96 passed, 3 skipped; Ruff and compilation clean |
| Source-linked Pages, brief, executive summary and download visibility | `scripts/build_site.py` built five HTML pages, 24 sources and five hypotheses; `tests/test_site.py`; generated docs use durable GitHub `blob/main` source links and no broken `../evidence`, `../knowledge` or `../registry` links | PASS locally; live Pages content still requires post-merge HTTP verification |
| Manual TIFF constraints and exact-file checks | `scripts/verify_downloads.py` | PASS: 121 checks, 0 failures; primary file SHA-256 `61f9b53de42786e6d48afa50fd453a87c57d5d7b9b626c7dcf28c2dfbd20f411`, exact 3730×3292 EPSG:32611 template, one float32 band, finite in-footprint values in `[0,1]`, content-addressed name and 138-character note. This is the existing H28-1 research reference, not an H31 result or slot authorization. |
| User's score-claim, manual-only and PR/merge constraints | README/summary/source review; no organizer receipt for 0.2477 or local TIFF; public 0.3195 row remains unlinked to owner/file; no DrivenData access | PASS; PR creation/merge and final live Pages verification remain delivery steps, not yet complete |

**Pre-fit decision:** reviews do not authorize a weekly slot. H31-1 may proceed only to its preregistered screen after these reviewed changes and current evidence are committed on the fixed Arena branch and the seed audit is refreshed immediately before the single-use claim. A screen/confirmation pass is proxy evidence only; any future TIFF requires its own fresh exact-file audit and cannot be auto-uploaded.
